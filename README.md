Hello World! If you're reading this, you've likely seen me on Twitter or have worked with me in some capacity before. I was tired of trying to memorize/bookmark every valuable GitHub repo I came across in my day-to-day cybersecurity research, so I decided to create my own GitHub profile to try and keep up with all the great resources available.

Although this initial "launch" will primarily be for research and reference, I also hope to begin contributing to some of my favorite open source projects in the near future.

I'm particularly interested in resources pertaining to security detections, audit and logging configurations, and really any tools for automating day-to-day processes for cybersecurity analysts.

As far as programming languages go, I imagine most anything I throw together will be using Python or some form of bash/shell script. If the moment calls for it, I'm also open to the idea of contributing to any projects that utilize queryinig languages that come standard with the various cybersecurity SIEM/EDR platforms.

Many thanks to all the security analysts before me who inspired me to create this page, and feel free to follow for any updates on projects that I'm working on. Likewise, for any additional inquiries, don't hesitate to reach out through one of the channels below.

Sincerely,

Murphy the Malware Lab
